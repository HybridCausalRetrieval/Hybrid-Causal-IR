# Causal Information Retrieval in Scientific Literature

This project implements an advanced retrieval system designed to answer complex **biomedical causal "WHY?" queries** by leveraging a hybrid approach that combines modern semantic search, and a causal knowledge graph.

## 🌟 Project Overview

The system aims to improve search result relevance, especially for finding **causal evidence**, by integrating two scoring mechanisms: semantic and causal scores.


1.  **Semantic Retrieval (BioBERT):** Uses vector embeddings for high-quality semantic similarity matching on document abstracts.
2.  **Causal Reasoning (Neo4j Graph):** Queries a **Neo4j graph database** containing causal relationships extracted from biomedical literature, providing a structured assessment of causal links.
3.  **Hybrid Scoring:** Combines the semantic similarity score ($\text{Semantic}$) and the causal path score ($\text{Causal}$) into a single, weighted **Hybrid Score** to re-rank results, prioritizing documents that are both relevant *and* contain causal evidence.

## 🚀 Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.8+**
* A running **Neo4j** instance configured with biomedical causal data (Concept nodes and CAUSES relationships).
* Required data files:
    * `./data/cleaned/cleaned_abstracts.csv`
    * `./data/embeddings/semantic_index.faiss`
    * `./data/embeddings/id_mapping.npy`
* An **OpenAI API Key** is required if you use the `summary_generate.py` module for LLM-generated summaries.

## ⚙️ Setup

### Dependencies
```bash
pip install pandas rank_bm25 neo4j python-dotenv spacy sentence-transformers faiss-cpu fuzzywuzzy openai biopython
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```
Create a `.env` file in the project root to store necessary credentials:

# Neo4j Connection
```bash
NEO4J_URI=bolt://<YOUR_NEO4J_HOST>:<PORT>
NEO4J_USER=<YOUR_NEO4J_USERNAME>
NEO4J_PASSWORD=<YOUR_NEO4J_PASSWORD>
```
# OpenAI API 
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>
```
## ▶️ How to Run

1.  **Run the Comparison and Evaluation**
    This script demonstrates the performance of the hybrid model against the two baselines and computes the causal evaluation metrics.
    ```bash
    python compare_retrievers.py
    ```

2.  **Run the Full Pipeline with LLM Summary (Recommended)**
    This script provides the most advanced output, combining the hybrid ranking with a high-level summary generated by an LLM (requires configuring `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env`).
    ```bash
    python summary_generate.py
    ```
    The output will include the top ranked documents followed by the combined summary.
